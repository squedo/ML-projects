From Kaggle's dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques the aim is to predict the value of houses.

We will have available:
- train .csv => model will be trained with those data, therefore contains X_train and y_train
- test .csv => contains X_test
- sample submitting data .csv => contains y_test

So far, mean squared logarithmic error (MSLE) on test data:
- MSLE multiple linear regression = 0.16
- MSLE neural network = 0.08
